## 1. Authentication and Authorization

- Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions for various GraphQL operations.
- Use Fastify Passport plugin for authentication and session management.
- Validate user input on both the client and server-side to protect against unauthorized access.

## 2. Data Encryption

- Ensure secure communication using HTTPS by configuring Fastify to serve content over SSL/TLS.
- Encrypt session cookies using a strong session secret, stored securely in an environment variable.
- Store sensitive data, such as API keys and passwords, securely using environment variables or secret management solutions.

## 3. Rate Limiting and Throttling

- Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and protect server resources.
- Throttle requests based on client IP addresses, user roles, or custom logic to ensure fair usage.

## 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

- Validate all incoming data, including query parameters, request headers, and request bodies.
- Implement input sanitization to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks.

## 5. CORS and Content Security Policy

- Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to restrict cross-origin access to your API.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent unauthorized loading of resources.

## 6. Logging and Monitoring

- Use the provided logger utility to log security events, errors, and other relevant information.
- Monitor the application and infrastructure for anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, and potential security breaches.
- Implement log retention policies to ensure historical data is available for auditing and forensics.

## 7. Security Updates and Patch Management

- Regularly update all dependencies and packages, including Fastify and its plugins, to address potential security vulnerabilities.
- Implement a patch management policy to ensure timely updates and minimize the risk of exploitation.

## 8. Secure Development Practices

- Follow secure coding practices, such as the OWASP Top Ten Project recommendations, to minimize security risks.
- Perform regular code reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- Train developers on secure coding practices, and encourage a security-aware culture within the development team.

## 9. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

- Implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure timely recovery of the application and infrastructure in case of a security breach or other incidents.
- Regularly back up critical data and systems, and ensure that backups are securely stored and easily recoverable.
- Test disaster recovery plans periodically to validate their effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.

## 10. Compliance and Security Audits

- Conduct regular security audits to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented security controls and identify potential areas for improvement.
- Ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS, as applicable.
